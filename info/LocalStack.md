To configure the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains to work with LocalStack, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains**:
    - Ensure you have the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains installed in your IDE. You can find it in the JetBrains plugin
      marketplace.

2. **Install the LocalStack Integrator Plugin**:
    - There is a specific plugin called "LocalStack Integrator" available for JetBrains IDEs. This plugin is designed to
      streamline the process of managing and integrating your local AWS environment via LocalStack directly into your
      IDE[4].

3. **Configure AWS CLI for LocalStack**:
    - Set up a new AWS CLI profile for LocalStack. You can do this by editing your `~/.aws/credentials`
      and `~/.aws/config` files to include a profile that points to LocalStack endpoints. For example:
      ```ini
      [localstack]
      aws_access_key_id = accessKey
      aws_secret_access_key = secretKey
      ```

      ```ini
      [profile localstack]
      region = us-east-1
      output = json
      ```

4. **Set Custom Endpoints in AWS Toolkit**:
    - Currently, the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains does not natively support custom endpoints for LocalStack directly within
      the plugin settings. However, you can use the LocalStack Integrator plugin to manage these configurations.

5. **Using LocalStack Integrator Plugin**:
    - After installing the LocalStack Integrator plugin, configure it to point to your LocalStack instance. This plugin
      will help you manage the integration and ensure that your AWS Toolkit can interact with LocalStack services.

6. **Run LocalStack**:
    - Ensure that LocalStack is running on your machine. You can start LocalStack using Docker:
      ```sh
      docker run --rm -it -p 4566:4566 -p 4571:4571 localstack/localstack
      ```

7. **Verify Configuration**:
    - Test the configuration by using the AWS Toolkit to interact with LocalStack services. You should be able to
      create, list, and manage resources as if you were interacting with AWS.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains to work with LocalStack,
allowing you to develop and test your AWS applications locally.
